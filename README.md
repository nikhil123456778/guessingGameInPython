ðŸ“˜ Overview

This is a simple Number Guessing Game built in Python.
The player decides how many rounds they want to play (1â€“9) and how many attempts they get per round (1â€“10).
Each round, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it.

ðŸ§  How to Play

Run the game using Python:

python game.py


Enter how many rounds you want to play (1â€“9).

Enter how many attempts you want per round (1â€“10).

Try to guess the number between 1 and 100.

The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low until you get it right or run out of attempts.

After all rounds, the game ends with a thank-you message.
